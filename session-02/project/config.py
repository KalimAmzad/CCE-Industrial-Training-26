"""Model constants for the ShopWise assistant — v0.1.

Constants only. No logic, no imports beyond os, nothing that can fail.

Every value is read from the environment with a default, so when Google retires a
model the fix is one line in `.env` rather than an edit in every snapshot:

    SHOPWISE_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash

These five names are the same in every session from here to v12. Code refers to
`config.MODEL`, never to a model ID spelled out in place.

# One tier up. Reach for it only when you can name a task the default fails.

# Search-grounded answers. Billed — not used before session 12.
MODEL_SEARCH = os.getenv("SHOPWISE_MODEL_SEARCH", "gemini-3.5-flash-lite")
