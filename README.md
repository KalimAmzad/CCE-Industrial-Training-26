# AI/LLM Application Builder — student workspace

**CCE Industrial Training 2026 · Grow with Data · instructor: Md Kalim Amzad Chy**

One project, **ShopWise** — an e-commerce customer-support assistant — built across 16 sessions,
from a first API call to a deployed app with a React front end. Each session lands here on the day
it is taught.

- **New to LLMs?** Watch [how-llm-works.kalimamzad.com](https://how-llm-works.kalimamzad.com/)
  first — a separate talk on how a language model actually works. No code, and it makes session 1
  much easier.
- **Class recordings** are shared after each session.
- **Everything installs once.** There is no per-session setup.
- **What the programme is:** the [brochure](brochure.html) — 8 weeks, 16 sessions, one system.

## Setup (once, ~15 minutes)

| | Install | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [**Cursor**](https://cursor.com) or [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com) | where you run the notebooks |
| 2 | [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | to get this repo and each new session |
| 3 | **uv** | builds the Python environment (step 1 below) |
| 4 | [**Gemini API key**](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) | free, no card |

> **Do not install Python.** `uv` downloads the exact version this course uses. Installing your own
> first is the most common way to end up with two Pythons and a notebook running the wrong one.

**1 · Install uv**

```bash
# macOS / Linux — Terminal
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows — PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Close the terminal and open a new one — the installer changes your PATH. Check: `uv --version`.

**2 · Clone the repo** — it's private, so sign in with the GitHub account you gave us.

- In Cursor/VS Code: **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P** → `Git: Clone` → paste the URL → sign in when the browser
  opens → pick a folder → **Open**.
- URL: `https://github.com/KalimAmzad/CCE-Industrial-Training-26.git`
- Each week, get the new session: **Source Control** → `⋯` → **Pull** (or `git pull`).
- Clone refused? Your GitHub account isn't on the repo yet — send your username to your instructor.
- **Windows:** clone into a plain folder such as `C:\dev\`, **not** a OneDrive-synced Desktop or
  Documents. OneDrive syncing a 1 GB `.venv` will break the environment and crawl.

**3 · Add two extensions** — **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X**, install **Python** and **Jupyter**. Without
Jupyter, `.ipynb` files open as unreadable JSON.

**4 · Build the environment** — open the terminal (**Ctrl+`**) in the repo folder:

```bash
uv sync
```

~1 minute on a good connection, and about 1 GB — have 2 GB free. It installs every package for all
16 sessions, so no session opens with a failed install and the whole cohort is on identical
versions. If it dies halfway, run it again; it picks up where it stopped.

**5 · Add your key**

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # macOS / Linux
Copy-Item .env.example .env     # Windows
```

Paste your key after `GEMINI_API_KEY=` — no quotes, no spaces. Never commit `.env`; it is
gitignored, keep it that way.

**6 · Check it, before class**

```bash
cd session-01
uv run python check_setup.py
```

PASS/FAIL for every requirement, with the fix printed beside each failure. Uses no network and no
quota. Fix the first FAIL, run again.

**7 · Open a notebook** — `session-01/session-01.ipynb` → **Select Kernel** (top right) → **Python
Environments** → the one ending in `CCE-Industrial-Training-26/.venv` → **Shift+Enter** to run a
cell. Prefer the browser? `uv run jupyter lab`.

### If something breaks

Nine times in ten it is the kernel: your notebook must run the `.venv` Python, not a system or
Anaconda one. Every notebook's first cell prints which interpreter it is using — read that first.

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `uv: command not found` | open a new terminal (PATH) |
| `.ipynb` opens as JSON | install the Jupyter extension — step 3 |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: langchain` | wrong kernel — step 7 |
| `AttributeError: 'Client' object has no attribute 'interactions'` | wrong kernel, older `google-genai` — step 7 |
| `DefaultCredentialsError: Your default credentials were not found` | wrong kernel: Anaconda ships LangChain 0.3, which never reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` — step 7 |
| A cell misbehaves | **Kernel → Restart and Run All** before debugging |
| `Repository not found` when cloning | your GitHub account isn't on the repo — send your username to your instructor |
| `429` / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | free-tier rate limit. Wait a minute and re-run — you have not broken anything |
| You pasted the key but a cell still says no key | restart the kernel — see below |
| `uv sync` stops partway | run it again; it resumes |

### Two habits that prevent most of it

**Restart the kernel after editing `.env`.** Python reads that file once, when the notebook first
imports it. Edit the key with the notebook open and the running kernel still holds the old value —
**Kernel → Restart**, then run from the top.

**Keep your own work in a copy.** Before you experiment in a lesson notebook, duplicate it:
`session-04/my-session-04.ipynb`. Next week's `git pull` updates the files we ship, and git will
refuse to overwrite one you have edited. If that happens:

```bash
git stash        # park your changes
git pull
git stash pop    # bring them back (resolve any conflict in the editor)
```

Still stuck? Screenshot the **whole** error and bring it to the next session. A setup problem is
worth ten minutes of class time and never a whole evening of yours.

## How to work

Every session folder is self-contained — open the one you are on, it runs on its own. You never need
`git checkout` to catch up.

```
session-05/
├── session-05.ipynb    # the lesson — follow along in class
├── exercises.ipynb     # after class (⭐ warm-up · ⭐⭐ apply · ⭐⭐⭐ stretch)
├── slides/index.html   # the deck — any browser, works offline
└── project/            # ShopWise as it stands after this session — runnable
```

- **Notebooks ship with their outputs**, so you can read any session without a key. Run every cell
  yourself anyway — watching your own code produce the output teaches far more than reading it.
- **Solutions are published one session late**, after the exercise review, so the exercises are
  worth attempting cold.
- **`project/` is a snapshot, not a shared codebase.** `session-06/project/` is `session-05/project/`
  plus that session's changes — `diff -r session-05/project session-06/project` shows exactly what
  moved.

## Assessment

| Component | Weight | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Attendance | **10%** | 16 sessions, Fri + Sat |
| Assignments | **20%** | the per-session exercises |
| Final project | **50%** | your capstone, demoed in session 16 |
| Viva (industrial) | **20%** | on what you built here |

> Your **department runs its own final viva** as well. That is a separate examination, separately
> marked, and is not the industrial viva above.

The capstone is briefed in session 15: extend your deployed assistant with at least two additions of
your own. Marked on working end-to-end, depth of the extension, code quality, debugging from traces,
and the presentation.

**Keys you need:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` from session 1 · a free LangSmith account from session 4 ·
a deploy account and Qdrant Cloud (free tiers) at session 15. Qdrant in session 8 runs **locally,
no signup**.

## Cost

The course runs on **Gemini's free tier** throughout, on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. Staying inside the
notebooks should cost you nothing.

- **Search grounding** is free only on `gemini-2.5-flash`/`-flash-lite` (500 requests/day) and
  **image generation is free on no model.** Both are instructor demos, marked 💳; those cells explain
  themselves instead of crashing on a free key.
- Free-tier limits are no longer published — check yours at
  [ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) and
  in your AI Studio dashboard.

> ⚠️ **Free-tier prompts are used to train Google's models** — Google lists "content used to improve
> our products" as **Yes** for free, **No** for paid. Never paste real customer data, real names, or
> anything belonging to an employer into a free-tier notebook. Every ticket in `data/tickets.yml` is
> invented for this reason.
