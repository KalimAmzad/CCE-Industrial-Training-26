"""Session 1 setup checker — run this before anything else.

    uv run python check_setup.py

Every check prints PASS or FAIL with the exact thing to do about it. Nothing here
talks to the network or spends any quota, so run it as often as you like.

If you are reading this after the session: work top to bottom. A later check
failing is often a symptom of an earlier one, so fix the first FAIL and re-run
rather than trying to fix them all at once.
